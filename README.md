# Oral Cancer Detection System

A comprehensive machine learning application for detecting oral cancer from images of the oral cavity.

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end solution for oral cancer detection using deep learning. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and management
- Multiple CNN model architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet, custom CNN)
- Model training, evaluation, and inference
- FastAPI backend for image processing and prediction
- React frontend with intuitive UI for image upload and result visualization

## Model Files

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the model files are not included in the repository. You need to download them separately and place them in the `model/checkpoints/` directory.

### Option 1: Download Manually

1. Download the following files and place them in the `model/checkpoints/` directory:
   - `latest_svm_model.pkl`
   - `feature_scaler.pkl`
   - `svm_20250524_121655_metadata.pkl`

### Option 2: Using the Download Script

1. Update the `scripts/download_models.py` file with the correct URLs for your model files.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python scripts/download_models.py
   ```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- pip
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Model Training

To train a model:

1. Prepare your dataset in the `data/raw` directory with class subdirectories.
2. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```
   cd data
   python preprocessing.py
   ```

3. Train a model:
   ```
   cd model/training
   python trainer.py
   ```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health`: Health check
- `GET /health/status`: Detailed system status
- `GET /health/model-info`: Model information
- `POST /predict`: Upload an image and get a prediction

## Deployment Instructions

### Deploying to Heroku

1. Install the Heroku CLI if you haven't already:
   - Windows: Download from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
   - macOS: `brew install heroku`
   - Linux: Follow instructions at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

2. Login to Heroku:
   ```
   heroku login
   ```

3. Create a new Heroku app:
   ```
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

4. Push your code to Heroku:
   ```
   git push heroku main
   ```

5. Scale the application:
   ```
   heroku ps:scale web=1
   ```

6. Your application will be available at `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`

### Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic deployment. The application uses default settings for development.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the Heroku logs:
```
heroku logs --tail
```

- `GET /health`: Health check
- `GET /health/status`: Detailed system status
- `GET /health/model-info`: Model information
- `POST /predict`: Upload an image and get a prediction
- `GET /predict/visualization/{filename}`: Get prediction visualization
- `POST /predict/batch`: Batch predict multiple images

## Performance Metrics
